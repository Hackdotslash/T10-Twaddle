Basic economic principle of incentives was our inspiration. We attempted to try and leverage this to incentivise the users for this specific use case of reducing Carbon Footprint and Climate Change.

### What it does

It allows users to register and start driving by connecting the car with mobile phones bluetooth. Shows their carbon footprint and rewards them in the form of virtual coins which can later be used to purchase vouchers from the Store section.

### How we built it

We used Python-Flask for the backend and Android app using Java. We used a Kaggle OBD dataset in order to form a regression model based on acceleration and fuel consumption to predict the driving efficiency of the driver.

### Challenges we ran into

The most difficult challenge was to manage the development process within the allotted time. Themes were released just the night before and we came up with this rather interesting idea. We had a lot on our plate compared to the time in hand.

### Accomplishments that we're proud of

We were reasonably able to finish the substantial part of implementation during the allotted time. Also we are pretty happy about the simple yet elegant UI that we developed.

### What we learned

We learnt about the wider applications and use cases of the technology concept of "driving efficiency" we were trying to utilise for our particular use case. Time management can never be left out of the list.

### What's next for ECO2Drive | T10: Twaddle

Improving the model for gauging driver efficiency, leveraging the Google Location API thoroughly and further improving the app UI are next on the list of tasks.

### Built With
